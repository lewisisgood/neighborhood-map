# Neighborhood Map
An interactive map of one of my favorite neighborhoods.

This project highlights some key locations with Google Maps markers on a map, using the Google Maps API. When a user clicks a location in the list on the left hand side, an info window is populated on the map for the location's respective marker. This info window contains information about the selected location, including a picture which is populated using the Foursquare API. Users can also search for specific locations in the list using the provided filter.
